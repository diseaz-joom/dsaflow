# What is it?

`jf` is a tool to implement Git workflow with less typing. Initially a
[Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
was in mind but tool may implement slightly modified workflows with
configuration.

# Disclaimer

It's not intended to be universally useful but suits me personally. Use at your
own risk.

The tool is absolutely experimental, unstable and going to break compatibility
and any random moment.
